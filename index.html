        <h3>WhatNext!</h3>
        <p>I participated in the making of a website that monthly updates the movies that are leaving, and coming to netflix. Along with that it 
          populates the slider to show the media, with an indepth description of the movie you would be watching!</p>

    <h3>About the Author</h3>
    <p>Whats up! Welcome to my Portfolio! My name is Dallin Suppes, I am 23 years old, and I am from Apex, North Carolina. I moved out to where I currently live in Idaho to go to school, and now my wife is just finishing up school out here!
      We have a 11 Month old son named Theodore who is a roudy handful, but he is the absolute best.
    </p>
    <p>If you are wondering why my portfolio looks so garbage, it is because I have had the stomach flu the past good couple days, but I am on the up. I should have it fully resubmitted in the next few days, along with my other work. Thanks!</p>
